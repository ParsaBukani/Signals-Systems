# Signals and Systems

This repository contains all computer assignments developed for the course 
**Signals and Systems**, offered by the 
**Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, 
University of Tehran – Fall 1404**, 
under the supervision of **Dr. Saeed Akhavan Behabadi**.

## Overview

The projects in this course explore fundamental and practical applications of signal and system analysis. They cover **MATLAB-based signal manipulation**, **digital image processing (ALPR)**, **information security through steganography**, **communication system modeling (FSK/Amplitude Coding)**, and **frequency-domain analysis** for radar target estimation and musical signal synthesis.
